========================================

PyMigrate is intended to run migrations in multi-environment setup (e.g. Test + Staging + PreProduction + whatever). Term _migration_ is being interpreted here more widely since it may include not only database schema change but also change to some service configuration.

This project exists only for my own educational purposes. While some of the concepts introduced here were actually used in production and I'm trying to do my best to polish all the functionality, I still cannot guarantee its _production readiness._ Just as usual: use at your own risk :3
